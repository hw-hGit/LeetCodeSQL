Table: Customer

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| referee_id  | int     |
+-------------+---------+
In SQL, id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the id of a customer, their name, and the id of the customer who referred them.
 

Find the names of the customer that are not referred by the customer with id = 2.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Difficulty:
The challenge lies in creating an SQL query that filters out customers with referee_id equal to 2 and then retrieves the corresponding customer names. Properly using the WHERE clause and joins forms the main difficulty.

Solution:
To find the names of customers who were not referred by the customer with id = 2, we can use an SQL query with WHERE and OR. 

Code:
SELECT 
    c.name
FROM 
    customer as c
WHERE 
    c.referee_id != 2
OR 
    c.referee_id IS NULL
